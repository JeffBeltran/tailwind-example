# Some Background/Context

One thing I want to highlight is that I have always wanted to build cool shit or solve interesting problems. It's why I think I gravitated towards programming as it has served as a great tool to allow me to do that.

As a result of this, I'm a self-taught developer. I did actually start my university as a CS major but it wasn't what I thought at the time, so I dropped out and only continued programming as a hobby. Then after a few years as a system administrator I found myself turning an excel document into a web app, and that is when I found my passion.

While I've worked across the stack, my expertise lies in the React/JS/TS world, and on my current team, I'm known as the frontend guy. I'm always eager to learn and expand my skill set. For example, I had to recently learn Elixir at my current job and fell in love with it, but I still find myself reaching for JS for most tasks.

Over the years, I have developed a strong appreciation for systems, like having a good style guide in place. In my current role, I'm responsible for junior and international team members. So having a style guide in place is key to streamlining code reviews as well as acting as a litmus test to vet new contractors. Here is an example [style guide](https://gist.github.com/JeffBeltran/1eb765013144e1cc7b2e009c57258b4c) that I set up for a project.

Another thing I love, but don't get to do enough of, is pair programming. I was thrilled to see this called out in the job posting. Outside of the outlined projects, this might be the most exciting part of the role for me.

Finally, one last item I would like to bring up is the "Shape Up" process, its something that I keep finding myself coming back to. I first learned about it a few years ago but I have recently been diving back into it again. I even started writing blog posts around it on [my website](https://www.jeffbeltran.com/) a few months ago, but ended up putting it on hold as I was getting stuff shipped for my Paris guide. However, I just recently enrolled in Ryan Singer's [Shaping in Real Life](https://www.feltpresence.com/srl/) cohort for this May. So I'll be excited to bring the practices I learned to my work at Tailwind Labs.
