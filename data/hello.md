# It's Me, Jeff!

Hey there, thanks for checking out my Tailwind Labs job application.

My name is Jeff, and I live in Seattle with my wife, **Martha**, two dogs: **LeeLoo** and **Korben**, and three cats: **Lennie**, **Georgie**, and **Ozzy**.

Currently, I'm a full stack developer working remote full-time during the day, and on nights and weekends, I'm putting on my business hat and hacking on my side hustle, building a [travel guide to Paris](https://www.parisinmypocket.com/).

I've been following Tailwind Labs for a while now and I'm constantly blown away by the quality of work you all put out. The attention to detail and the level of polish in your products is something I strive for in my own work. When I saw the list of upcoming projects in the job posting, I knew I had to throw my hat in the ring. Most, if not all of them, are really interesting problems that I've been itching to sink my teeth into but never found the time to tackle on my own (particularly around IDE integrations). The idea of diving deep into these challenges and building cool stuff with the Tailwind Labs team is just too damn exciting to pass up.
